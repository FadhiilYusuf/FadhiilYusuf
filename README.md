I am an active 7th semester student at the Polytechnic Engineering Indorama majoring in D4 Software Engineering Technology. Besides being active in college, I am also active in activities outside of lectures, such as organizational activities, bootcamps and other activities. Previously, I had participated in activities on an independent campus, namely the Independent Study Program (SI) at MyEduSolve partners, took the Data Science pathway for 5 months and already had 4 international certificates, I am currently participating in the Certified Independent Study Internship (MSIB) activity at PT. Indonesia Indicator for 5 months. I also have an interest in the IT world, especially in the fields of Back End Developer and Data Science. In my opinion, these two fields have an important role, especially in the current technology era because they can work in the startup world and have flexible working hours, problem solving skills. View analysis data wherever you are. Various knowledge and skills in several other fields
